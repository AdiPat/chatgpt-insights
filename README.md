### Explainable AI 🧠

In the age of "black-box" machine learning, **ChatGPT Insights** cracks the opaque facade.

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Transparency**: Understand your prompting style, the topics you gravitate toward, and how effectively you interact with ChatGPT.
- 📈 **Accountability**: Ever wonder why ChatGPT missed the mark? This tool helps you analyze ambiguous prompts and improve your own query game.
- 🎯 **Optimization**: Knowing _what_ you ask and _how_ you ask it is the key to extracting the full potential of generative AI.

Explainable AI isn't optional anymore; it's table stakes. 🃏
